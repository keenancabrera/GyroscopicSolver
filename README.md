# GyroscopicSolver (CURRENTLY BROKEN)

The equation of motion for the gyroscope are not being solved properly in this codebase. I completed this project by moving to a Vue.js webapp and generating the video animation using vector graphics instead. You can find it at https://github.com/keenancabrera/GyroscopeVisualizer
